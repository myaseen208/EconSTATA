# Linear Model {#LM}

## Introduction

The model relating the normal dependent variable $Y$ with the explanatory variables $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_q$ is

\begin{align}
Y & = \gamma_{1}X_{1}+\gamma_{2}X_{2}+\cdots+\gamma_{q}X_{q}+\epsilon \label{eq:LM1}\\
Y & =\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\bm{\alpha}+\epsilon=\bm{\alpha}^{\prime}\mathbf{x}+\epsilon \label{eq:LM2}
\end{align}

\begin{example}
A mortgage department of a large bank is studying its recent loans. Of particular interest is how such factors as the value of the home (in thousands of dollars), education level of the head of the household, age of the head of the household and current monthly mortgage payment (in dollars) relate to the family income. Are these variables effect predictors of the income of the household?
\end{example}


## Linear Modeling Approach
Linear Model (LM) can only measure direct effects

## Strucural Equation Modeling Approach
Strucural Equation Model (SEM) can measure direct as well as indirect effects
